      <h1>Welcome to Tootski!</h1>

    <div id="bd">
      <p>Tootski is a browser extension that allows you to boost, follow, or favorite from outside your home Mastodon server, and instantly share any non-Mastodon page you might be reading.</p>
      <p>If you're seeing this because you clicked a link on Mastodon, <strong>go get Tootski now!</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firefox: [addons URL]</li>
        <li>Chrome: <a href="#todo">coming soon, we promise!</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're seeing this because you just installed, <strong>here are a few things to do and notice.</strong></p>
      <h3>Just This Once, Clean Up Your Tabs</h3>
      <p><strong>Because you just installed, existing tabs don't know about Tootski yet until you reload them.</strong> If you have a bunch of tabs going right now--you do, don't you, you tab hoarder you!--please pull this one off into a new window and work in there.</p>
      <h3>Pin the Toolbar Button</h3>
      <p>On install, most browsers will hide your extensions behind a menu. It's probably shaped like a puzzle piece, at the top right of your screen. <strong>Find it and click it, and then pin Tootski to your toolbar.</strong></p>
      <p><img src="ff_pin.png" alt="Screenshot from Firefox, showing how to pin the browser button to the toolbar."></p>
      <p>Right now the button is probably gray, meaning Tootski doesn't know whether you're signed in to Mastodon or not. To fix this, <strong>open your home page on Mastodon in a new tab</strong>, be sure you're signed in, and then come back here.</p>
      <h3>Share a Page</h3>
      <p>If all went well, your Tootski button should have lit up purple. <strong>Click it now to see what sharing a page looks like.</strong>  (But come back here, we've got more to look at!)</p>
      <p>When your first sharing page popped up, the text box was filled with whatever we had set in the title of this document, which is <code>Don't mind me, just setting up my #tootski</code>.</p>
      <p><img src="ff_share.png" alt="Screenshot from Firefox, showing default text in share."></p>
      <p>If you share this without modification you will include the <code>#tootski</code> hashtag. This will make discovering Tootski much easier for other Mastodon users, so thanks very much in advance!</p>
      <p>To easily enter something else besides the title of our page, <strong>try highlighting any text on this page and clicking the browser button again</strong>. Up to the first 200 characters of what you highlighted should come up as the default post, meaning: it's really easy to share a quick quote from an article on Mastodon.</p>
      <h3>Hashtag Reminder</h3>
      <p>Unless you just highlighted something with a hashtag in it, your Publish button will look different. Until you type a hashtag, the button will carry a #? reminder and will be the Mastodon alarm color when you hover, possibly red. It's there to remind you to include a hashtag, or else your post or reply won't be searchable or eligible for "trending" lists, so it won't get as many interactions. Relax: it's just there as a reminder and won't block the button.</p>
      <p><img src="ff_hashtag_reminder.png" alt="Screenshot from Firefox, showing the hashtag reminder."></p>
      <h3>Boost, Follow, or Favorite, While Away From Your Home Server </h3>
      <p>Visit a Mastodon server that's not your home, and find a post or account you like. Click the boost, favorite, or follow buttons, and the Dreaded Modal Dialogue will appear, as usual.</p>
      <p>Ah, yes, the <strong>Dreaded Modal Dialogue</strong>. If you've been using Mastodon long enough you've probably trained yourself never to click those foreign boost, follow, or favorite buttons, because the Dreaded Modal Dialogue will pop up and the next set of steps (copy some stuff, open your home server in a new tab, paste it in, search, find the thing you were looking at, and then do whatever it was you wanted to do) is such a daunting process.</p>
      <p>But look! In the middle of the Dreaded Modal Dialogue, there's <strong>a brand-new button under With Tootski.</strong> Click that button once to boost, follow, or favorite, watch it spin for a bit, then click it again once it comes back--note that it's now alarm-color on hover, possibly red--to undo whatever you just did.</p>
      <p><img src="ff_follow.png" alt="Screenshot from Firefox, showing the Tootski button in the Dreaded Modal Dialogue."></p>
      <h3>Multiple Accounts</h3>
      <p>Tootski is meant to work and play nicely with multiple accounts. For best results, have them up somewhere in a pair of tabs so you can switch back and forth quickly. Whichever one you viewed last will be the one that comes up on your Tootski button; you should not need to reload anything to make it work, even if the Dreaded Modal Dialogue is already up with your Tootski button.</p>
      <h2 id="todo">Things We're Working On</h2>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Shipping for Chrome</strong> It's very early days yet and Google takes an absolutely glacial time to review extension submissions, so we're going to stay Firefox-only until we're sure that taking two to ten days to fix a bug wouldn't be disastrous.</li>
      <li><strong>Inline Reply</strong> You ought to be able to click a Reply button and have it just work. Unfortunately we can't put up an inline reply form (because we don't know your home server's rules about post length, number of images, etc.) and there is no known way to feed a Mastodon server a search string and get the results form to auto-populate, which would be a step in the right direction towards finding the post you want to reply to.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source</strong> As soon as we feel comfortable enough to release for Chrome, Tootski will be up on GitHub.</li>
      </ul>
